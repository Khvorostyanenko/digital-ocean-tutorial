<h1>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</h1>
<p>What?! I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<p><strong>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed.</strong> <em> The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</em> Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<h2>You don't believe in the Force, do you?</h2>
<p>I call it luck. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>

<li>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</li><li>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</li><li>You don't believe in the Force, do you?</li>
</ol>

<h3>He is here.</h3>
<p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm trying not to, kid.</li><li>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</li><li>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?</li>
</ul>

<p>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Ye-ha! She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
<p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. You mean it controls your actions? You don't believe in the Force, do you? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</p>
<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
<p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… I find your lack of faith disturbing. Don't underestimate the Force.</p>
<p>What?! I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
<p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>
<p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
<p>What!? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
<p>I call it luck. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I call it luck.</p>
<p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</p>
<p>Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
